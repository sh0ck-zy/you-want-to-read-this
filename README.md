# You Want to Read This**

## **Introduction**

In a world drowning in information, reading has become a chore, not a pleasure. Our attention spans are being crushed by instant gratification, making it harder than ever to focus on what really matters—especially for researchers who need to sift through mountains of academic papers. 

But what if we could change that? What if we could create a system that not only finds exactly what you want to read but also shows you insights that make reading exciting and efficient again? That’s where **sh0ck.zy.25** comes in. This is the beginning of something big—a journey to build a tool that will redefine how researchers interact with literature. 

This document will guide us through the creation of our Proof of Concept (PoC) for the **You Want to Read This** system, focusing on core components that will turn this vision into reality.

## **Project Overview: Building Blocks of Innovation**

We're not just building a single system—we're developing powerful, modular components that will come together to create a revolutionary product. Each component is an epic in itself, with the potential to become colossal as we iterate and improve. 

### **Epic 1: Knowledge Discovery and Recommendation**

**Objective:** 
Create a system that processes a collection of research papers, understands their content, and generates accurate, relevant recommendations. We’ll leverage a combination of semantic analysis and content-based filtering to deliver results that matter.

**Components to Develop:**

1. **Content Understanding:**
   - **Goal:** Use NLP techniques to create semantic embeddings for each paper. These embeddings will represent the content in a way that the system can understand and compare.
   - **Tools:** Start with TF-IDF for simplicity, then explore BERT or GPT-based embeddings for deeper semantic understanding.

2. **Feature Extraction:**
   - **Goal:** Identify key features from each paper that are crucial for understanding its content. These features will be the backbone of our recommendation engine and future enhancements.
   - **Tools:** Develop custom algorithms or models that can predict and extract these features from the text.

3. **Displaying Knowledge:**
   - **Goal:** Clearly define what information we need to show to the user. This includes accurate recommendations, summaries, and insights extracted from the content. The focus here is on the backend—figuring out what we need to display before worrying about how it looks.
   - **Tools:** For now, focus on processing and organizing the data; visualization can come later.

**Immediate Tasks:**
- Set up the development environment.
- Process the arXiv dataset and start building basic TF-IDF models for content understanding.
- Develop the feature extraction component to identify what’s important in each paper.
- Combine these elements to generate accurate, relevant recommendations.

### **Epic 2: Summarization and Insight Extraction**

**Objective:** 
Develop a system that can automatically summarize papers and extract key insights, providing researchers with quick, valuable overviews of their content.

**Components to Develop:**

1. **Summarization:**
   - **Goal:** Build models that can generate concise, meaningful summaries of each paper, retaining the core information while cutting out the noise.
   - **Tools:** Start with existing NLP libraries like spaCy or NLTK, and explore more advanced summarization techniques as needed.

2. **Key Insight Extraction:**
   - **Goal:** Automatically identify and highlight the most important points in each paper. This will include key arguments, results, and conclusions that the user needs to know.
   - **Tools:** Use NLP tools and custom algorithms to scan the text and extract these insights.

**Immediate Tasks:**
- Implement basic summarization techniques and refine them based on output quality.
- Begin experimenting with key insight extraction to see what’s possible with the current data.
- Ensure that the extracted insights are accurate and useful for making research decisions.

### **Research Topic for Later: Innovative Metadata Creation**

**Objective:** 
Explore the potential of creating a new form of metadata for each paper—answers to key questions like Who, What, When, Where, and How. This metadata could become the cornerstone of advanced features like personalized recommendations, deeper content understanding, and future predictive analytics.

**Components to Develop Later:**
- Custom NLP models to extract and generate this metadata.
- Methods to integrate this metadata into the recommendation engine and other system components.

**Why It’s Important:** 
This idea has the potential to disrupt how research information is stored and accessed. By creating rich, textual metadata, we can refine recommendations, summaries, and insights in ways that current systems can't match. But for now, we’ll leave this as a topic for future research and development.

## **Expected Outcomes**

By the end of this PoC, we aim to achieve the following:

- **Accurate Recommendations:** A system that can take a collection of papers and provide a list of relevant recommendations based on semantic content and feature extraction.
- **Organized Knowledge:** A backend that can process and organize the information in a collection of papers in a smart way, leading to new discoveries and deeper insights.
- **Summarization and Insights:** AI-driven summarization and key insight extraction that gives researchers a quick, valuable overview of what’s important in the content.

## **Next Steps: From PoC to Product**

The PoC is just the first step. Once we have a working prototype, we'll iterate on the components, improving their accuracy, efficiency, and usability. The ultimate goal is to evolve this into a product that researchers can rely on daily—a tool that makes finding and understanding research information not just easier, but smarter.

## **The Zoro Vibe: Precision and Power**

Like Zoro, we’re taking a disciplined, focused approach. We’ll slice through the challenges one by one, starting with a strong foundation and building on it relentlessly. Each piece of technology we develop will be fine-tuned and powerful, and when combined, they’ll create something truly game-changing.

Let’s get to work, step by step, and build something that not only works but is destined to become a cornerstone in the world of research.

This document serves as a guide and a declaration of intent. It’s about making each step count, building tech that delivers, and keeping our eye on the ultimate goal: revolutionizing how research information is discovered and utilized.

Let's make this happen.
